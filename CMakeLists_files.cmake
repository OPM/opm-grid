# This file sets up six lists:
# MAIN_SOURCE_FILES     List of compilation units which will be included in
#                       the library. If it isn't on this list, it won't be
#                       part of the library. Please try to keep it sorted to
#                       maintain sanity.
#
# TEST_SOURCE_FILES     List of programs that will be run as unit tests.
#
# TEST_DATA_FILES       Files from the source three that should be made
#                       available in the corresponding location in the build
#                       tree in order to run tests there.
#
# EXAMPLE_SOURCE_FILES  Other programs that will be compiled as part of the
#                       build, but which is not part of the library nor is
#                       run as tests.
#
# PUBLIC_HEADER_FILES   List of public header files that should be
#                       distributed together with the library. The source
#                       files can of course include other files than these;
#                       you should only add to this list if the *user* of
#                       the library needs it.
#
# ATTIC_FILES           Unmaintained files. This for the projects developers
#                       only. Don't expect these files to build.
